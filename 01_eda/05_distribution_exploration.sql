-- Highly right-skewed distribution (skewness 9.15): vast majority of 99,440 orders cluster at lower values, with a long tail of rare high-value outliers.
-- Center: median $105.29 better represents typical order than mean $160.99, as extreme values pull the average upward.
-- Spread & range: IQR $114.96 (Q1 $62.01–Q3 $176.97) shows half of orders fall in a moderate band; overall range $0–$13,664 with std. dev. $221.95.
-- Visual summary: Histogram peaks sharply at low values then drops off; boxplot confirms dense lower cluster plus many high outliers. Overall, small-to-medium orders dominate, with occasional large purchases.

-- Shape: Right-skewed distribution with most freight ratio cluster on the lower side, and a long gradual tail of outliers. Unimodal with one peak at 12.5% then drops off gradually
-- Center: since distribution is right-skewed, the median of 18.3256 is better representation of a typical freight ratio as the mean (20.8804) is being pulled towards the higher side by the extreme ouliers (rare large freight ratio)
-- Spread: freight ratio ranges from 0% -> 95.5451%, however, 50% of all orders have freight-value in a quite narrow band of 11.6502% - 27.5463% (IQR: 15.8961)
-- Visual summary: freight ratio peaks early at lower ratios then drops off gradually towards the end; box clot confirms dense lower freight ratios, with many high outliers. In summary, smaller freight ratios dominate, with occasional high freight ratios that drops off gradually in frequency as we go higher.
